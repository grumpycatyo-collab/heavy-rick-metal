# Prologue

Hey, I was searching for a side project to do to enhance my skills in Data Science and I found a interesting dataset on Rick & Morty. Thought that it will be an engaging experience to analyse the colorful texts of these characters. 

The dataset I'm using I took from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/rickmorty-scripts). I inspired from the [Sentiment Analysis: Rick and Morty Scripts](https://www.kaggle.com/code/andradaolteanu/sentiment-analysis-rick-and-morty-scripts#notebook-container) Notebook done in R.

The project is currently ongoing. Hope I will manage to finish it.
